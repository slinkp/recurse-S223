Hi recursers! I'm Paul (he/him).
I'm in Brooklyn so I expect to be spending much of this batch onsite.

As a programmer, I'm self taught, most proficient in Python. I worked on
mostly web backend, for a series of smallish startups over
the past 20 years. (That included a long stint at OpenPlans, where I met Nick
and Sonali before they started Recurse!)
For the past 4 years, I was a staff developer at Shopify doing Ruby on Rails
until I was laid off this spring. I still don't feel like a Ruby expert.
Or a staff developer. Imposter syndrome never really ends for me, but it gets better.

Not having had a formal computer science education, I feel like I still
have a lot of gaps in fundamentals. Right now I'm most excited to finally
learn functional programming for real -- I'd like to get fluent in a Lisp.
Maybe even write a lisp interpreter. I'd like to get into the guts of Emacs
and see how much damage I can do.

Aside from programming, I am a pretty good bass player and a less-good guitar
player. I spend a lot of time with my 14-year-old daughter (zero interest in programming).
I am (almost) divorced and my girlfriend is awesome. I like reading, walking
outdoors, being at the ocean or in the woods, and yoga though i have really
slacked off on that. Lately interested in psychotherapy (have been exploring
different kinds myself).

Also, my cat (Socks aka Li'l Soxie Purrbox) is the best cat, and so is yours!
